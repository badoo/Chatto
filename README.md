`Chatto` is a Swift lightweight framework to build chat applications. It's been designed to be extensible and performant. Along with `Chatto` there is `ChattoAdditions`, a companion framework which includes cells for messages and an extensible input component. You can find more details about how it was implemented in our [blog](https://techblog.badoo.com/blog/2015/12/04/how-we-made-chatto/). See them in action!
